# advent_of_code_2020
This repo contains source code for the advent of code 2020 written in Dart.  What a perfect way to have some fun and practice my Dart skills!

These solutions can be run using

```bash
$ dart run puzzle_1.dart
```

or they can be compiled natively

```bash
$ dart compile exe bin/aoc.dart -o build/aoc
$ build/aoc
```

You will need to create the `bin` directory if it doesn't exist.  This directory is already in the .gitignore file.
